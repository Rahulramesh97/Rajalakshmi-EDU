AdaBoost Classifier** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n\n[Back to Notebook Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **AdaBoost or Adaptive Boosting** is one of the ensemble boosting classifier proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996. \n\n- It combines multiple weak classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. \n\n- AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier. \n\n- The basic concept behind Adaboost is to set the weights of classifiers and training the data sample in each iteration such that it ensures the accurate predictions of unusual observations. \n\n- Any machine learning algorithm can be used as base classifier if it accepts weights on the training set. \n\n- **AdaBoost** should meet two conditions:\n\n   1. The classifier should be trained interactively on various weighed training examples.\n  \n   2. In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- To build a AdaBoost classifier, imagine that as a first base classifier we train a Decision Tree algorithm to make predictions on our training data. \n\n- Now, following the methodology of AdaBoost, the weight of the misclassified training instances is increased. \n\n- The second classifier is trained and acknowledges the updated weights and it repeats the procedure over and over again.\n\n- At the end of every model prediction we end up boosting the weights of the misclassified instances so that the next model does a better job on them, and so on.\n\n- AdaBoost adds predictors to the ensemble gradually making it better. The great disadvantage of this algorithm is that the model cannot be parallelized since each predictor can only be trained after the previous one has been trained and evaluated.\n\n- Below are the steps for performing the AdaBoost algorithm:\n\n  1. Initially, all observations are given equal weights.\n  \n  2. A model is built on a subset of data.\n  \n  3. Using this model, predictions are made on the whole dataset.\n  \n  4. Errors are calculated by comparing the predictions and actual values.\n  \n  5. While creating the next model, higher weights are given to the data points which were predicted incorrectly.\n  \n  6. Weights can be determined using the error value. For instance,the higher the error the more is the weight assigned to the observation.\n  \n  7.

Difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5\"></a>\n\n\n[Back to Notebook Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **AdaBoost** stands for **Adaptive Boosting**. It works on sequential ensemble machine learning technique. The general idea of boosting algorithms is to try predictors sequentially, where each subsequent model attempts to fix the errors of its predecessor.\n\n\n- **GBM or Gradient Boosting** also works on sequential model. Gradient boosting calculates the gradient (derivative) of the Loss Function with respect to the prediction (instead of the features). Gradient boosting increases the accuracy by minimizing the Loss Function (error which is difference of actual and predicted value) and having this loss as target for the next iteration.\n\n\n- Gradient boosting algorithm builds first weak learner and calculates the Loss Function. It then builds a second learner to predict the loss after the first step. The step continues for third learner and then for fourth learner and so on until a certain threshold is reached.\n\n\n- So, the question arises in mind that how AdaBoost is different than Gradient Boosting algorithm since both of them works on Boosting technique.\n\n\n- Both AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting build weak learners in a sequential fashion. Originally, AdaBoost was designed in such a way that at every step the sample distribution was adapted to put more weight on misclassified samples and less weight on correctly classified samples. The final prediction is a weighted average of all the weak learners, where more weight is placed on stronger learners.\n\n\n- Later, it was discovered that AdaBoost can also be expressed as in terms of the more general framework of additive models with a particular loss function (the exponential loss).\n\n\n- So, the main differences between AdaBoost and GBM are as follows:-\n\n\n  1. The main difference therefore is that Gradient Boosting is a generic algorithm to find approximate solutions to the additive modeling problem, while AdaBoost can be seen as a special case with a particular loss function (Exponential loss function). Hence, gradient boosting is much more flexible.\n\n\n  2. AdaBoost can be interepted from a much more intuitive perspective and can be implemented without the reference to gradients by reweighting the training samples based on classifications from previous learners.\n\n\n  3. In Adaboost, shortcomings are identified by high-weight data points while in Gradient Boosting, shortcomings of existing weak learners are identified by gradients.\n\n\n  4. Adaboost is more about ‘voting weights’ and Gradient boosting is more about ‘adding gradient optimization’. \n\n\n  5. Adaboost increases the accuracy by giving more weightage to the target which is misclassified by the model. At each iteration, Adaptive boosting algorithm changes the sample distribution by modifying the weights attached to each of the instances. It increases the weights of the wrongly predicted instances and decreases the ones of the correctly predicted instances."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **6.
